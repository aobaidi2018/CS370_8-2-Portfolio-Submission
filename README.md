# CS370_8-2-Portfolio-Submission
Brief Explanation of Work on Project Two:

In Project Two for CS 370, I developed a pirate intelligent agent using deep Q-learning, a type of reinforcement learning algorithm, to navigate a treasure hunt game environment. The goal was to create an agent capable of learning and optimizing its actions over time to maximize rewards by finding the treasure efficiently.

Code Provided:

•	The project included a predefined environment setup, which consisted of the game grid, treasure, and pirate agent.

•	Basic functionality for agent movement and environment interaction was provided, along with a framework for running simulations.

Code Created:

•	I implemented the core deep Q-learning algorithm, which involved defining the agent's neural network architecture to predict Q-values (expected future rewards) for different actions.

•	I wrote the training loop, where the agent explored the environment, learned from its actions using the Q-learning algorithm, and gradually improved its strategy.

•	I also implemented functions to visualize the agent's learning progress and evaluate its performance over time, enabling me to monitor and refine the agent’s behavior.


Connection to the Larger Field of Computer Science:

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter? 
Computer scientists design, develop, and optimize algorithms and systems to solve real-world problems. Their work underpins technological advancements in various fields, from healthcare to finance to entertainment. This project exemplifies the impact of computer science by demonstrating how AI techniques like reinforcement learning can be used to create autonomous systems that adapt and improve over time, which has broad applications in areas like robotics, gaming, and decision-making systems.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist? 
As a computer scientist, I approach problems by first breaking them down into smaller, manageable components and understanding the underlying principles that can be applied. For this project, I began by studying the requirements for the pirate agent and understanding the concepts behind deep Q-learning. I then incrementally developed the solution, testing and refining each part to ensure it met the project’s objectives. This iterative, analytical approach is central to problem-solving in computer science, where understanding both the problem space and the tools at your disposal is crucial.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization? 
Ethical responsibilities in computer science include ensuring that the systems we create are fair, transparent, and do not cause harm. This means being mindful of biases in AI algorithms, protecting user data, and ensuring that the technology aligns with societal values and organizational goals. In the context of this project, although it was a simulated environment, it reinforced the importance of creating systems that are reliable and behave as expected, which is critical when these technologies are deployed in real-world applications where they impact people’s lives.
